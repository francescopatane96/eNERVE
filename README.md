eNERVE is a dynamic, high-throughput and standalone in silico pipeline for ```PVCs``` (protein vaccine candidates) discovery in ```eukaryotic``` organisms, by a ```reverse vaccinology``` approach. 
 
The tool is capable of identifying candidate ```antigens``` (immunogens) and their ```epitopes``` with ```ML``` (machine learning) and ```alignment``` analysis methods, using a tree based approach, from entire proteomes as input (```FASTA``` file of proteomes downloaded from Uniprot and other databases or generated from proteome experiments).

The output generated by the pipeline is a general ```CSV``` file containing every candidate protein with relative score and predicted values (P_adhesin, P_antigen, location etc..), a CSV file with discarded proteins and a series of files (CSVs, PNGs) located in specific folders for every protein selected to predict corresponding epitopes. 
 
eNERVE is a flexible tool that allows you to select specific modules and cutoffs to use during proteome analysis and protein classification task (please, see ```Usage``` section of this ```README``` for more informations).

eNERVE is designed to assist experimental research activities in vaccine discovery and vaccine formulation for eucaryotic targets, making use of the data available to the scientific community and using it to create machine learning models that can facilitate and economize the process of antigens discovery to formulate protein and subunit vaccines.

Are you searching for a ```bacteria``` vaccine discovery pipeline? Please visit NERVE (```bNERVE```) repository, [here](https://nicolagulmini.github.io/NERVE/) and [here]( https://github.com/FranceCosta/NERVE) .

 ### 💻 Pipeline architecture and data flow:
 ![alt text](https://github.com/francescopatane96/eNERVE/blob/main/workflow.png)
 
 1. Quality control of proteome module and generation of protein instances: proteins that do not pass QC process are discarded (discarded_sequences.fasta);
 2. Descriptors calculator module: this module uses [iFeature library](https://github.com/Superzchen/iFeature) to calculate protein descriptors for every protein in the input proteome;
 3. Subcellular location module: Random Forest-based model (scikit-learn) to predict the probability of being 'outer' (training dataset from [UniProt]( https://www.uniprot.org/));
 4. Transmembrane topology prediction module: TMHMM (Hidden markov model). Predicts the probability of each aminoacid to be 'i', 'o' or 'M'. For more informations, please visit tmhmm [repository](https://github.com/dansondergaard/tmhmm.py) ;
 5. Razor module: virtual scissors that cut outer protein pieces and rejoin them. This is useful to retrieve the outer segments of proteins with many transmembrane domains and to discard the latter.
 6. Adhesin and adhesin-like predictor module: feed-forward neural network (Tensorflow/Keras). Training dataset obtained from literature and [InterPro](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/);
 7. Antigenicity predictor module: feed-forward neural network (Tensorflow/Keras). Training data obtained from [IEDB database](https://www.iedb.org/)
 8. Autoimmunity and allergenicity module: Alignment based method (ncbi blast+)
 9. Selection and scoring module
 10. Linear epitope predictor module: [epitopepredict library](https://github.com/dmnfarrell/epitopepredict)
 11. Conservation module between proteome1 and proteome2, if proteome2 is added to the analysis
 12. Output generation module
 ***
 
 ### :accessibility: Instructions for stand-alone usage with Docker and dockerhub (preferred method):

eNERVE can be used as a stand-alone version taking advantage of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose/) in linux systems. This method ensures no dependencies related issues.

1) install Docker following [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [the post-installation procedure](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
2) install docker-compose as explained [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)
3) open the terminal and digit:
```
sudo docker pull francescopatane/enerve:tag
```
4) create a directory (eg. on Desktop) called 'output' and give it permissions with:
```
chmod 777 /path/to/output
```
5) Then, put your input FASTA files in the directory;

6) Run docker image and select a volume for sharing input from local machine and output from virtual machine:
```
sudo docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/output_directory:/workdir -v francescopatane/enerve:tag
```
7) go to root folder with:
```
cd ..
```
8) run eNERVE pipeline with:
```
python3 nerve.py -wd [], -dfd [./], -p1 [filename.fasta] -args**
```
9) At the end of the computation you will find output files in your 'output' directory in the local machine, in this case in your Desktop in the directory ```output```

 ### 🏠 Instructions for local installation (tested with python3.10.6 and 3.7.14 versions in Linux/Ubuntu/Unix OS environments):
 
 1. Open the terminal, move to the location in which you would save eNERVE:
 ```
 cd /home/ubuntu/Desktop/
 ```
 2. clone the repository on your machine:
 ``` 
 git clone https://github.com/francescopatane96/eNERVE.git
 ``` 
 3. move to the directory:
 ``` 
 cd eNERVE
 ```
 4. Clone DeepFri repository:
 ``` 
 git clone https://github.com/francescopatane96/DeepFRI.git 
 ```
 5. Download pre-trained models from [flatironinstitute](https://users.flatironinstitute.org/~renfrew/DeepFRI_data/newest_trained_models.tar.gz), then uncompress ```tar.gz file``` into the ```DeepFRI directory```:
 ```
 tar xvzf newest_trained_models.tar.gz -C /path/to/DeepFRI
 ```
 6. clone iFeature repository:
 ``` 
 git clone https://github.com/francescopatane96/iFeature.git
 ``` 
 and install numpy:
 ```
 pip install numpy
 ```
 7. install tmhmm library:
 ``` 
 pip install git+https://github.com/francescopatane96/tmhmm.py.git 
 ```
 8. install ncbi-blast +:
 ``` 
 sudo apt-get install ncbi-blast+ 
 ```
 9. install tensorflow:
 ``` 
 pip install tensorflow 
 ```
 10. install scikit-learn library:
 ``` 
 pip install -U scikit-learn 
 ```
 11. finally, install remaining dependencies:
 ``` 
 pip install -r requirements.txt 
 ```
 
***
### 🤖 Instructions for creating a virtual environment with Python venv (Linux/Unix/Mac OS):
1. open a terminal or a terminal from an IDE (pyCharm or visual code studio);
2. move to destination folder:
```
cd /path/destination/
``` 
and clone the repository :
```
git clone https://github.com/francescopatane96/eNERVE.git
```
3. move to root directory:
```
cd eNERVE
```
4. Install ```python3-venv``` package digiting:
```
sudo apt install python3.10-venv
```
5. create a virtual environment with python module ```venv``` (to avoid dependencies conflicts) with: 
```
python3 -m venv enerve
```
6. activate your new virtual environment with: 
```
source enerve/bin/activate
```
After venv activation, the terminal will shows virtual environment name between ```()```, eg. ```(nerve)```;

7. Now, you have to install dependencies (from point 4 of the previous section) needed for the pipeline.
***
### 🔴 We recommend using conda for creating a virtual environment:

1. from the terminal, digit: 
```
conda create --name enerve python=3.10
```
2. Clone the repository;

3. activate the environment:
```
conda activate enerve
```
4. install dependencies as in previous sections.

***
### ⛑️ Examples

To run eNERVE with all modules:

```
python3 nerve.py -wd /workdir -p1 proteome.fasta
```
To run eNERVE without annotation (-a) module, mhc1 ligands length of 10, mhc2 ligands length of 15 and epitope percentile of 80:
```
python3 nerve.py -wd /workdir -p1 proteome.fasta -a False -prt 0.80 -m1l 10 -m2l 15
```

 1. digit:
 ```
 cd eNERVE
 ```
 2. create your working directory (where you will put in fasta.file to be analyze and where outputs will be saved);
 3. move to ```code``` directory:
 ```
 cd code
 ```
 4. In the terminal, digit and run:
 ```
 python3 nerve.py -arg1 -arg2 -args**
 ```
:warning:
 REMEMBER TO SPECIFY -wd (WORKING_DIR), -nd (NERVE_DIR) and -p1 (eventually also -p2). Place your fasta inputs into the wd
 :warning:
 
 5. Output files will be saved in the working directory at the end of the computation
